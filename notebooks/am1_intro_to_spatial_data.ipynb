If you've never used an API before this might be a fun introduction to how most servers talk to each other on the web.\n\nBefore you get going you will need to have a LocationIQ API key - something that authenticates you as 'not a bot' to LocationIQ's servers. You can get one by heading over here and signing up for an account: https://locationiq.com\n\nThen you'll need to create an access token to let Python access the API.

So it turns out that there are several 'places' associated with the name 'Empire State Building'. In particular we now have point locations (latitude and longitude) and even a full display address that we could use to add value to our data. Which one you pick is up to you but note that LocationIQ also provides an 'importance' attribute that you could use to filter your results.\n\nFor now, let's extract the latitude and longitude and put this on a map, all in Python. We're going to use `cartopy` to generate our maps and handle the projections for us.

Typically geospatial processing code uses Python in the backend and JS for rendering in the frontend.\n\n## Exercise\n\n1. Write a function `get_position` that geocodes a given location. Start with the following\n\n```python\ndef get_position(location_string):\n    \"\"\" Get the latitude and longitude of the given location\n    \n        Returns the location with the highest likelihood from the LocationIQ API\n     \n        Parameters:\n            location_string - The location to geocode, for example\n                'Eiffel Tower' or 'Empire State Building'\n        \n        Returns:\n            the location as a numpy array: [longitude, latitude]\n    \"\"\"\n    # your code here\n```\n\n2. Then make a list of addresses in Pandas (as a Pandas Series) and apply your function to generate longitude & latitude columns in the data\n\n#### Note:\nThe locationiq API has a request rate limit which may be problematic when requests exceed a per second or per minute limit. To avoid errors related to this, implement a delay in the request either by altering the function you wrote above or by implementing a decorator function so that you do not have to alter the function as written. Adding a delay in the requests can be done using `sleep` in the `time` [package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html), alternatively use a [decorator](https://pythonguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/decorator.html) so that you do not have to modify the function itself.\n\n#### _Bonus: Plot the locations a map!_","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_position(location_string):\n    \"\"\" Get the latitude and longitude of the given location\n    \n        Returns the location with the highest likelihood from the LocationIQ API\n     \n        Parameters:\n            location_string - The location to geocode, for example\n                'Eiffel Tower' or 'Empire State Building'\n        \n        Returns:\n            the location as a numpy array: [longitude, latitude]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Talk to the API \n    token = \n    url =\n    data = {\n        'key': ,\n        'q': ,\n        'format': 'json'\n    }\n    response = \n    \n    # Check results\n    if not response.ok:\n        raise ValueError('Response not ok')\n    \n    # Get best result\n    results = [\n        (float(result['lat']), float(result['lon']), result['importance']) \n        for result in response.json()\n    ]\n    best_result = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x[2])[-1]\n    lat, long, _ = best_result\n    return np.array([lat, long])\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"position = get_position('Eiffel tower')\nposition","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_data = pd.Series([\n    \n])","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
