# Takeaways & Reflection

Today we've:

* covered the basic concepts of spatial data: space, location and distance, and the different methods we use to talk about these concepts, including absolute, relative, topological and cognitive measures.
* covered the basics of geospatial data analysis, including set theory constructions, spatial indices and geocoding.
* covered how geospatial processing can form part of a larger machine learning or data science pipeline, particularly as a feature generator for machine learning algorithms.
* covered how to design an effective pitch that considers the audience, communication styles and content structure.
